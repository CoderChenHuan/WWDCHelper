Inspired by qiaoxueshi/WWDC_2015_Video_Subtitle, ohoachuck/wwdc-downloader, and @onevcat's videos. Thanks for their inspiration and efforts. üëè

## Info

WWDCHelper is a command line tool on macOS for you to get WWDC info easily. Now you can get download links of SD/HD video & PDF, and download subtitles in English or **Simplified Chinese** directly by it.

You can also download all the subtitles of WWDC 2017 directly in this repository, or you can also choose English or Chinese version at the [releases](https://github.com/kingcos/Learning-WWDC/releases) page.

> **Notice:**
> 
> Although I have written in Swift for years, I still have a lot to learn about Swift. And to be honest, CLI (Command Line Interface) is not familiar for me. So this program is not perfect, even a little wired. So you can issue me if you have any questions, advices or find some bugs . I will be very appreciated for your help. ‚ù§Ô∏è
